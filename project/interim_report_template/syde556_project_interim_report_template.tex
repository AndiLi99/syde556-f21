	\section*{SYDE 556/750 Interim Project Report}

	\emph{Your Name -- Your Student Number}

	Since we have to cancel in-person project presentations, I'm instead asking you to write a one (minimum) to two (maximum) page interim project report. Just like the presentations, this is mainly to ensure that everyone has started to work on their projects.

	Correspondingly, this interim report will \emph{not be marked}, but failure to submit a report by\\[0.25cm]
	{\centering\bf April 2nd, 2020 11:59 PM EST (sharp!)\\[0.25cm]}
	will result in a \textbf{10 mark penalty on the final grade} (this corresponds to 25\% of the final project). The interim report must be submited via email to \texttt{astoecke@uwaterloo.ca}.

	After reading your report, I'd optimally have answers to the following questions in my head (and answering these questions would also have made for a good presentation). But please do not just respond in bullet-point form to the questions below, i.e., you should write one page of prose without copying these questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Background:} What is your project about? Which example is it an extension of or what do you plan to research.
		\item \emph{Motivation:} Why do you think that this is interesting?
		\item \emph{Plan:} Which steps do you want to follow to complete this project?
		\item \emph{Intermediate results:} What have you done so far? Do you already have some results? If yes, what are the results? If no, were there any unexpected roadblocks you hit? Did questions pop up that you did not have before (what are those questions)?
	\end{itemize}

	Formatting-wise, the document you submit should approximately look like this one (12pt, 125\% line spacing, 1" border spacing, Palatino or similar font). You can find a LaTeX template that you can fill out at this URL:
	\begin{center}

	\end{center}

	Of course, feel free to use any word processing application of your choice.
